# The Effects of Climate Change on Northeastern Forests

## Overview
This project is a simple attempt to asses how rising annual temperatures have impacted the species composition of forests in Maine. 
* First, I explore how mean annual temperatures have changed in Maine over the past fifty years. 
* Then, I analyze relationships between annual mean temperature and species prevalence on a county level for twelve regional tree speices. 
* Finally, for the species shown to be most sensitive to temperature, I map the changes in their range within Maine from 1995 to the present. 

I used a gridMET data layer, accessed via Climate Engine, representing mean annual air temperature from 1979-present at 4 km spatial resolution. I also obtained county level temperature data from NOAA National Centers of Environmental Information. 

I accessed forest species composition data using the U.S. Forest Inventory online Evalidator tool. I downloaded the estimated acreage of each forest type by county. 

## Results

The first part of my analysis demonstrates how mean annual air temperatures in Maine have increased over the past decades.
